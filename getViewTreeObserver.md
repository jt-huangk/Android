Be careful to use view.getViewTreeObserver()

1)the object could be different from the one in onCreateView and onDestoryView in Fragment

After attch to windowï¼Œ the object is mAttachInfo.mTreeObserver; otherwise  is mFloatingTreeObserver

2)you should check whether the ViewTreeObserver is still alive. Otherwise, you risk an exception or a memory leak.
